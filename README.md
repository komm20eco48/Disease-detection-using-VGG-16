# Brinjal Disease Detection and Remedy

## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for a project focused on the classification of brinjal diseases using deep learning techniques. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of training a model to classify different diseases in brinjal plants and generating remedies for the detected diseases.

## Project Components

### 1. Jupyter Notebook
- The core of the project is the Jupyter Notebook file `Brinjal_Disease_Detection_and_Remedy.ipynb`. This notebook provides detailed information on how to:
  - Preprocess and augment the dataset
  - Train a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras
  - Detect diseases in brinjal plant images
  - Generate remedies for detected diseases using a language model
  - Translate remedies to multiple languages

### 2. Dataset
- The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `Datasets` folder. It includes images of brinjal plants with different diseases and corresponding labels for classification.

## Usage
- You can open the Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab to run and experiment with the code. Ensure that you have the required libraries and dependencies installed.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries and packages were used in this project:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Transformers (for the language model)
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- Googletrans (for translation)
- PIL (Pillow)

## Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project was collected from Kaggle, GitHub, and Google, and is credited to the respective contributors from those platforms.
